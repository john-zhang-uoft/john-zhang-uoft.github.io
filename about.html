                    <li><h3>Music</h3></li>
                    I love playing and listening to music, especially the piano and the cello. I enjoy playing music
                    with my
                    brothers,
                    composing and arranging music, and listening to music of many different genres.

                    <li><h3>Programming</h3></li>
                    I enjoy programming and I am currently working on Fortissimo 451, a 2D RPG made with the Unity
                    engine.

                    <li><h3>Debate</h3></li>
                    I've been practicing and competing in debate competitions for 5 years! I won top speaker at the
                    MacGill University Summer 2020 Online Cup and have placed top 10 teams in several other
                    tournaments.

                    <li><h3>Big Data Challenge</h3></li>
                    My team was and I were national finalists in the 2020 STEM Fellowship Big Data Challenge for High
                    School
                    Students where we used big data analysis to predict hurricane trends in coming years.
